# Lung Simulations using k-Wave Acoustics Toolbox
Repository to share the codes of lung models simulated using k-Wave acoustics toolbox for normal, edematous, and consolidated conditions.

Lung simulation models could supplement and complement the experimental models (which may be expensive and have repeatability concerns) and provide a better insight to clinicians into the physics of lung behavior.
